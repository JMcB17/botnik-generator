# botnik-generator
Create a new Botnik AI predictive keyboard from a youtube playlist by downloading its subtitles.

Run it, paste youtube playlist url, and it will create botnik-boards/board.txt.

On pip: `python -m pip install botnik-generator`

Note: if you put in something with no subtitles, it will create an empty file. Also, you can just put in a single video if you works. It just gives the url to [youtube dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl), which can handle a lot of stuff.
